<h1>Sildrea</h1> 

<p>Sildrea

Sildrea is the island with the largest range of inhabitant races, ranging from Voldryne inhabitants, to native Sildreans, to the races that live under the water. 
Due to the less than friendly attitude of Voldryne, Sildrea is often the most visited of the islands of Agoria, which is another reason it has such a wide range of inhabitants. Sildrea also is home to the Quiora and Kolrabyi. 
Arling Nesvora Serence rules Sildreaâ€™s Sonata Dynasty in the place of her missing mother, the Teyrnas Mardri Serence. Her insistence on finding her mother has caused many upper noble courts to worry about her sanity, and one or two to suggest her removal from power.

<p>Saliria

Saliria is the city of the Kolrabyi, off the west coast of Sildrea and to the east of Sarcross.
Completely submerged, it receives very few visitors, due to the fact that most other creatures cannot breathe underwater. 
Saliria is known for its trade of pearls, seaweed, and the elusive Coralbloom fish.
